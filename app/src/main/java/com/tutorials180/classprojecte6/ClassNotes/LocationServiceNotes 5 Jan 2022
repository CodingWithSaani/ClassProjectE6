Lecture Class Learning Outcome
1- How to find out actual address from given LAT and LNG
2- How to send text message using from your mobile application


<Steps to achieve first CLO>
Step 1: We made changes to XML in order to display address
           a) Street address
           b) City
           c) Province
           d) Zip code
           e) Country name

Step 2: We declared and initialized GeoCoder class's object
Step 3: We create a new function with name "getActualAddress()"
        What this function will do:
        It will take lat and lan and then will convert to actual address

Step 4: We convert us Lat, LNG to actual address using geoCoder class's object
Step 5: We will map address that we get from geoCoder to XML views.

Step 6: Call the "getActualAddress()" inside "onLocationChanged()" method

<Steps to achieve second CLO>
Step 1: Create a separate package for it "SMSWorking"
Step 2: Create a new activity "SMSWorkingActivity"

Step 3: Add Views to SMSWorkingActivity's XML
        a) EditText for receiver phone number
        b) EditText for text message
        c) Button to send message

Step 4: Create ViewBinding object of SMSWorkingActivity to bring XML views to Kotlin file.
Step 5: Add SEND_SMS permission to Manifest file.

Step 6: Add onClickListener to sendSMSBtn and call sendSMS method inside it.
